				<div id="introContent">In this semester of Engineering, we learned a variety of engineering skills such as CAD (Computer Aided Design) and Machining. We learned these useful skills through our Wobbler "Steam" Engine Project. The objective of this project was to successfully machine a Wobbler machine. Throughout this project, we learned how to utilize the lathe and mill during the process of making the different components of the Wobbler. In addition, we learned how to machine precisely and effectively. During the fabrication process, we were constantly challenged with learning new skills and applying them to making our steam engine components. Although we ran into various problems with the sizing and human error, we perservered and were all successful in creating functional Wobbler "Steam" engines.</div>

Then, bevel the edge with a flat file and remove the piece. Put the piece back into the lathe with the faced side in. Make sure to check the piece is concentric before facing the piece to a final thickness of 1/4 inch. Bevel the edge and then using a pilot drill, spot the axle hole. After using the pilot drill, use a 7/32 drill bit to drill through the piece. Then, use a 1/4 inch reamer and remove from the lathe. Finally, mark the location of the crank wheel using marking dye and drill the crank pin hole. Use a pilot bit first, then a 3/32 drill bit. </div>

For the pivot holes, use a 9/64 inch drill bit and 0.276 inch drill bit for the axel bearing hole. Remount the piece (facing up this time), and use a 5/32 inch drill bit to drill the bottom mounting holes with a depth of 3/4 inch. Then, use a 7/32 inch drill bit to countersink the holes to a depth of 1/4 inch. Lastly, tap the holes using a 10-32 thread tapping tool to a depth of 1/2 inch. </div>

Center punch each of the holes. Square the other end of the cylinder head to length, then drill the two side holes. For the pivot hole, use a #29 drill bit. The valve hole uses a 3/32 inch drill bit. Then, drill bore the cylinder hole to depth. Start with a pilot drill, and gradully increase the drill size from 1/4 inch to 15/32 inch, then finish with a 1/2 inch end mill to flatten the hole at the bottom. The 1/4 inch hole should be to a depth of 1.125 inches, and the 15/32 inch should have a depth of 1.3 inches. Lastly, polish the inner cylinder walls with sand paper on a lathe.</div>

Attach the piston rod end to the piston using loctite and wait for several hours. Then, put the piston into the lathe with piston side sticking out. Face the piston to reduce the length to 3/8 inch. Turn outside diameter until piston fits the cylinder hold. Make sure to avoid taking off too much material by making small cuts. To make the piston rod end, clamp a brass rod in a vise and cut with a dremel. Smooth off the ends on a sander and then drill a 0.093 inch hole within an 1/8 inch from one of the ends. Place the rod into the lathe and center drill a 3/32 inch hole with a 1/2 inch depth. Part off the rod 3/8 inch from the end.</div>

Sand/cut the piston rod to length. Ensure the piston rod's height is correct then attach the piston rod end. Plug up the holes on the cylinder head, and attach the ports on the tower using loctite. Make a flat area on the shaft for the set screw. Attach the tower to the wood base and attach the piston, piston head, flywheel, shaft, and crank wheel.

				<div id="conclusion">In conclusion, we were able to create functional wobbler engines. This project served as a great introduction into learning how to utilize the different tools in the shop and taught us the basics of machining. Futhermore, the process of making our wobblers gave us a deeper understanding of the crucial process in engineering. We first started with the CAD models and gradually transitioned towards machining each of the different components before finally assemblying them together. This process enabled us to have a expanded comprehension on how the assembed wobbler would functions and made it easier to machine the indiviual components. Overall, the process of making the wobbler engine was an enjoyable and valuable experience.</div>
